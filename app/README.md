# AI Phishing Detector Web App

This Flask web application provides a user-friendly interface for the AI Phishing Detector.

## Features

- Simple, clean interface for URL analysis
- Detailed feature breakdown with visual indicators
- Confidence scoring
- Categorized detection signals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
pip install flask
```

### Running the Application

1. **Make sure you have trained the model first** by running the retrain script from the root directory:

```bash
# From the root ai-phishing-detector directory
python retrain_model.py
```

This creates the required model files in the `models/` directory:
- `models/phishing_model.pkl`
- `models/feature_names.pkl`

2. Start the Flask app from the app directory:

```bash
# From the app directory
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Directory Structure

The application expects the following directory structure:

```
ai-phishing-detector/
├── models/                  # Generated by retrain_model.py
│   ├── phishing_model.pkl
│   └── feature_names.pkl
├── data/                    
│   └── raw/
│       └── top-1m.csv      # Optional: top 1 million domains list
├── src/
│   ├── url_feature_extractor.py
│   └── ...
└── app/
    ├── app.py              # Flask application
    ├── templates/
    │   └── index.html
    └── README.md
```

## How It Works

The web app uses the same machine learning model and feature extraction logic as the command-line tool. When you enter a URL:

1. Features are extracted from the URL
2. The model makes a prediction based on these features
3. Results are displayed with a confidence score
4. Detailed feature analysis is shown in categorized sections

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Error: Model not loaded", make sure you've run `retrain_model.py` from the project root directory first
- The warning about `data/raw/top-1m.csv` is normal if you don't have this file - the app will use a fallback domains list
- For network-related issues with WHOIS lookups, those features may show as "Unknown"
